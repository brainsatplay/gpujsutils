## gpujsutils

gpu.js is amazing and this makes life easier to use it and add baked but flexible functionality. This revolve around persistent kernels with resizable i/o on-the-fly so we can make the best use of the performance benefits of parallelization. This is even better with web workers (see our MagicWorker library)

```
npm i gpujsutils
```


```
import {gpuUtils} from 'gpuUtils'

let gpu = new gpuUtils();

//annnnnd look at the code and read gpujs's docs for the rest (for now), lots of goodies

```
